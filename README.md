# DJ-Rai - CS 477 App Project by Maryam Kargar and Michael Pham

## How to set-up

Note: There are two different build.gradle files Android Studio uses. One outside the app folder
and one inside the app folder.

In the top-level directory for the project, copy and paste build.gradle.

In the app folder, copy and paste the other build.gradle file. Also place the google-services.json inside the app folder.

At this point, Android Studio should say a message like you have to sync Gradle now or something like that. Press the sync button.

Inside /DJRai/app/src/ is all the java and xml files. Of course these have to go in their respective folders.
